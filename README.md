# 8-bit-CPU
Implementation of a 8-bit CPU on CircuitVerse.
It is a final project for a course at my University.

The description of the project can be found in the report.pdf file.

The CPU has a 256 byte Control-ROM which stores 8-bit opcodes for any program you want to run. It also acts as the data cache.
The 8-bit instruction is parsed by the control unit into a 20-bit control word, which orchestrates all other units functioning.

To open the project, simply import the cv file into CircuitVerse simulator.
